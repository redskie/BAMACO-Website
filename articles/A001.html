          <p>As someone who's been playing maimai and other rhythm games for a very long time, accuracy for me has become a very important skill to master especially if you're trying to really get good at the game. A couple of things I did back when I was starting to get a hang of the game was adjusting my speed until I found the speed I was comfortable playing at, which in this case for me was 8.25. Do note that everyone has their own preference in speed so no need to worry about it when you feel like you play a tad bit slower than others. Another thing that helped me improve my accuracy was the judgement display I use. The judgement display I currently use is 3-D which means perfect, great, and good notes would show a text displaying "Fast" or "Late" depending if I hit the note a bit early or a bit late (again, it's player preference if you do decide to use this type of judgement display because again, everyone prefers something else from others but I do recommend trying this). Knowing your judgement timing mid game helps you adjust your tempo when playing to ensure a higher score count. </p>
